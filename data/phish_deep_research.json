Dynamic changes of tempo and volume throughout. Also, anytime you hear random whispering in a Bowie it is an A+ version. Almost a children's song feel to the jam at 11:30 before transitioning into a Mango Song jam, which then turns into a start-stop jam. A Magilla jam acknowledges the jazz influence on this experimental version. Afterwhich the rock tension cranks up and Bowie wraps up this great version.

The longest jam of 1998 up to this point (by a decent margain). Full band groove that starts drifting away from Jim. Loops at 9:00. Still delicately playing with Jim theme. Heads for space around 12:30. Dissonance at 13:45. Repeated decending notes. Great interplay between Trey and Page. Moves to a blissful, uplifting jam around 17:15. Starts to fall apart at 20:45. Bluesey return to the lead for Trey at 21:30. 23:45 more loops now we're wide open. Nobody grabs the wheel immediately, so the funk comes lightly. Mike takes the lead. Post funk groove with page playing synth over it (25:35). Weird spacey keyboard effect at 26:30. More great Trey/Page interplay, find a descending 4 chord pattern. They don't move away form it. Repetitive and boring. Returns to theme.

This jam goes through so many structural changes and layers within the same idea its no wonder it is often reffered to as the jam of the year. Throughout the entire piece we hear hints of the storage jamming elements we heard at Superball. At times (16:00) the jam sounds haunting, tractor beams and whails form all directions and an omnious drone that is only leveled out by Fishman's free drumming.  The jam ends with an INCREDIBLY funky jam that any fan of 97 would want to go on for another 20 minutes but then fades quite perfeclty into Meatstick.

A long and tasteful jam full of heady nuggets this jam was featured as THE feature of the \"Fuck Your Face\" show and for good reason. Listen to how Trey's rhythmic chording enables Mike to step in with some gorgeous bass undulations in the 7th and 8th minutes. Fishman's light as air touch enables the band to cohere and develop truly succinct musical ideas. Around the 11th minute, Trey latches onto one of the most beautiful phrases, a 10/ 11 note melody of such power and emotion that it carries the band all the way through the rest of the jam. Cubism at work. At the 14th minute, Trey reconnects with the rhythmic feel of the earlier jam section and makes contact with a big time pathway up the mountain, which he first runs by the other guys and who give him the permission to take the truck into high gear. At 15:50 Page lays down some nice atmospherics for Big Red to go for gold. At 16:05 he does, finds the gold nugget lying in wait in the melody thats carried them for the better part of twenty minutes, and begins sending little patterns of ore into the atmoshere with his tremolo, which he then accelerates, delivering lasers of sound into the Colorado evening.

The roll-swing from Fish is slowed down, but very groovy, almost a quasi-waltzy feel. Page still laying low, getting a vibe, but still inserting the perfect Rhodes component.  Lots of slowed-down and sped up tempos with a little tractor beam intro in the middle. Very experimental jam still staying with the Whipping Post style.

Trey signals an end to the jam sesgment by playing a slow descending scale, but just when the sefment would end with Page's organ, Trey steps back in with more to say. Time modulation occurrs. Only Fish is still in Mike's. A throbbing bass and keyboard section signal new territory. Random yelling ensues. Alternate lyrics too.

In partuclar listen to Mike's bouncing rollicking bass lines, he's really cushioning this whole thing in a soft upbeat style. Page's synth work, again inspired by the Talking Heads, adds such a rich textural layer to this jam.

From Fish's drum intro to the post-verse jaunts like at the 3:51 - 4:13 mark, Phish knew they were ready for an epic summer. Jam starts at 5:21 somewhat abrubtly with Trey realizing the other guys want to bring it down a bit. Immidiate Tweezer groove. Not quite Type II yet but cetainly the \"coming up\" period. 6:32 sees some Trey & Page interplay with a descending riff that expands out a bit. At around 7:11 Fishman starts to splash out the drums more and we almost again see Type II but then he brings it back, Trey catches on and by 7:28 we're full Type I rocker again launched by Fish. Very patient Trey playing, nothing too out of the box but very suitable for the jam. Mike is almost non-existent. Slight thumping through the 8th minute but jam is definitely a Trey post-game highlight reel with Fish running the projector. 9:28 again Fish splashes out the drums a bit and we fade out into MF MF.","","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm4cJEqEoLQ","http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2011-05-27","","","N","N/A"],["Jah","2011-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","Bethel Woods Center","Bethel, NY","Stash"," Mid-Set","1899-12-30T19:13:00.000Z","Acid Jazz","Type 1","Basic Tension and Release (Stash)","Dark, Sinister, Evil"," Full-Band","","","","Jam starts at 4:58 with Trey running up and down to build tension. Again very patient and focused playing from Trey. 5:40 \"Maybe so Maybe Nots\" end but the jam is almost soley Trey and Fish. Slight mike thumping can be heard as Page adds slight 2-3 note trills. 6:21 the band starts to lock into a bit of a tension groove that has really polarizing elements. 6:43 we get a break and the jam begins to build, Fish getting more sporadic in his drumming. 7:01 Trey initiates another tension build that seems to fizzle and then gets slowly brought back very fluidly with a peak at 7:51 that leads into another build and much more dramatic tension release at 8:23. Just when the idea beings to feel stagnant at 9:01 Fish begins in with his crash and the band builds a screaching peak at 9:39 which is arguably the apex of the jam. 10:00 shows some more trills from Page playing off frantic Trey squeals. 10:19 Trey kicks in the \"Maybe So, Maybe Not\" riff and the song winds down.","","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJhEpvrz3Q","http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2011-05-27","","","N","N/A"],["Jah","2011-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","Bethel Woods Center","Bethel, NY","Kill Devil Falls"," Mid-Set","1899-12-30T21:03:00.000Z","Classic Rock"," Type 2","Bliss Jam","Happy (Major Chords)","Trey","Whale-Call","","","The jam starts at 4:00 and like the earlier Tweezer the band immediately locks into a solid full band groove. Trey's playing is very subtle and adds perfect direction to the bands playing. 4:55 Trey and Fish begin playing around with the dynamics of the jam which lead to a bit of delay noodling at 5:12 - as Trey messes around with this Page provides some brief distraction. At 5:28 Trey announces Type II with an almost DJ-esque string scrape. Trey still resembles the KDF jam but is now something more ethereal and airy. 6:26 the band begins to tone it down and by 6:43 their playing is at its more stripped down. Trey;s guitar still has a dreamy tone to it while the rest of the band sticks to an earthier sound. 7:37 the jam starts to pick up steam and for the next minute the band starts laying down another foundation that by 8:43 begins to materliaze a build. The build lasts for a while as we see some whale calls at 9:39 that are quickly abbandoned in favor of building the jam again. By 10:09 Trey's guitar playing is more concentrated again and he makes a few attempts at a builds that are decent through 11:20 but never materliaze, by which point he begins to wind down the jam. At  11:54 return to the KDF riff - end jam","","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAw3my78r5I","http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2011-05-27","","","Y","Type I > Type II"],["Jah","2011-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","Bethel Woods Center","Bethel, NY","Carini"," 2nd Set Opener","1899-12-30T15:26:00.000Z","Psychedelic rock","Type 1","Standard Rock Jam (Type 1)","Dark, Sinister, Evil","Trey","","","","Very standard Carini 5:37 Trey teases his guitar shrieks which immediately get shelved for more straight forward tight Type I jamming which starts to wind down at 6:21.

The band is completely locked with Mike soloing, Trey sliding the verse chords strategically in between everything. At 4:20 the band is able to augment the jam through Fishman changing up the beat. Once again at 4:39 - the band really shows their range with plinko style in this jam. At 4:56 Trey begins to get into the plinko mix. His guitar literally sounds like its being torn apart by the matrix. by 5:22 and again much of more fiercely at 5:52. This wind down is the sound equivalent of a steam engine running out of steam and continuing to try and putter along. The band is very tight as a transition like this is no easy task. By 6:55 Fishman's drumming breks up the structure and we enter an \"air-space\". Some spaceship tones at 7:20 and Page adds more space elements at 7:39 with the organ.

Trey phrases some simple pieces and mike joins at 8:17. 8:26 Trey and Page both start a cascading idea that begins a somewhat circular jam lasting until 9:05. The cycle is broken up by Page as he lays a steady two note foundation for a new jam direction. However by 9:32 the jam is stripped to almost nothing. By 10:00 just Trey tapping notes over faint fishman snare rolls. 10:17 Mike starts to tries a frantic build which Trey plays with for a bit but eventually melts away. By the 11 minute mark this evolves into a more full sound.

Truly stunning and beautiful stuff. But the jam isn't over as the bliss jam gives way to some murderous Wails from Trey, who starts stabbing out at the invisible ghosts in the room.

Mostly blissful, light, the first part of the jam section features Mike's undulating tonally perfect bass lines driving us down this sweet sweet river of sound, allowing Trey the room and musical freedom to explore, prod, poke, tease at a a number of equally gorgeous melodies. Around the 9th minute, Trey leeches onto a particular melody and from then on they're locked in for the remaining 6 minutes. Page adds some lovely vamping in the 10th minute pushing Trey into more atonal waters, but not for too long as the celebratory theme continues. In the 11th minute, Trey finds the PERFECT riff to end this immaculate set. Takes it all the way home. Mostly a three note riff that he explores in different keys and modes as the band coheres and gains steam behind him. Trey starts to really wail in the 12th minute, sustaining some notes for effect and really making the heads weep with joy.

A long and tasteful jam full of heady nuggets this jam was featured as THE feature of the \"Fuck Your Face\" show and for good reason. Listen to how Trey's rhythmic chording enables Mike to step in with some gorgeous bass undulations in the 7th and 8th minutes. Fishman's light as air touch enables the band to cohere and develop truly succinct musical ideas. Around the 11th minute, Trey latches onto one of the most beautiful phrases, a 10/ 11 note melody of such power and emotion that it carries the band all the way through the rest of the jam. Cubism at work. At the 14th minute, Trey reconnects with the rhythmic feel of the earlier jam section and makes contact with a big time pathway up the mountain, which he first runs by the other guys and who give him the permission to take the truck into high gear. At 15:50 Page lays down some nice atmospherics for Big Red to go for gold. At 16:05 he does, finds the gold nugget lying in wait in the melody thats carried them for the better part of twenty minutes, and begins sending little patterns of ore into the atmoshere with his tremolo, which he then accelerates, delivering lasers of sound into the Colorado evening.

Meanwhile Page starts building some atmospherics with his Rhodes. Mike drops in some thick envelopes as Trey comps him on the rhythmic motif the band had developed. Around the 11th minute the dynamics pick up as the band locks into this thick polyrhythmic jam and Trey starts to pitch shift around playing around with the same motif he isolated.
