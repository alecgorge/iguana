Lotus does a great job of adding warm guitar improvizations with a house/trance/funk type of groove kinda like STS9 or the new deal but different.  \\nLotus improvizes a great deal and they are a very tight unit as well.  I can really hear a lot of freedom in Lotus\'s music.  While with STS9 (they may be tight sounding) they just don\'t \\\"jam\\\" enough for me.  And while the new deal may jam (and are really sweet at the house jams)they just seem one dimesional in the sense that they mostly stick to house beats/grooves. Lotus really blends a lot of different styles very well.  Not to mention that the drummer is a freakin human beat machine!  Lotus is leading the trance/house jam band scene eventhough there are many worthy coleaders.

I arrived with my son and 5 of his high school friends.  Since I was over 21 (closer to sixty), they let us in.  Actually, we were told that the show was sold out and we talked to the manager who I had happened to call earlier in the day and reminded him of that phone call and he let us in. Before the show began one of the members of Lotus (don\'t remember which on) told us that this is their first sold out show and what a magical evening it turned out to be.  During their intermission, I asked if it I needed a stamp to get back in and the doorman laughed because I was about 35-40 years older than everyone else and he told me that he would remember me.  I walked outside and loved the smell.  Everyone outside was indulging.  Since this show, I have seen Lotus at least 20 times (who is counting) from a very small venue (small boat around NYC harbor that held maybe 75 people) to a huge concert hall in Chicago   (over 2,000 people). I wish I was 40 years younger so I could become a groupie and just follow them around.

First off, Ia ppreciate all of teh kind reviews. This show was DOPE and the recording luckily came out to match the energy of teh night.\\n\\nSecondly, the word \\\"bootleg\\\" really irks us tapers. Bootleg is a word stemming from someone who illegally records a musical performance and then turns and sells it for a personal profit. The word \\\"bootleg\\\" does not apply to teh jamband world because the music/shows are ALLOWED to be recorded LEGALLY and us tapers DO NOT SELL the recordings. They are distributed freely and we DO NOT make a personal profit :) These are just considered free live music downloads ;)\\n\\nSorry, but as a longtime taper of this types of music, it really irks us tapers as a whole, because the word bootleg is thrown at the lowest form of tapers. And we are not even close to that league of taper ;) We are the \'Good Tapers\' and give our recordings away for free, juts like it was meant to be :) Please don\'t take this the wrong way folks. I am not trying or intending to be some \'elitist taper\' or anything like that. I am just educating you, the fans, on the labeling of shows you can get freely, as \'bootleg\'s. It simply gives us tapers a bad name in most respects :) Have a great night and everyone enjoy this fine download :) \\n\\nP.S.-I wish lotus would come back to Mr. Smalls(or ANYWHERE in Pittsburgh) again soon.

Magical comes to mind. Unique. Perfect. Lets add it up: 1. NLQP is the most beautiful and hospitible spot you could hope for for a midsize summertime fest. A quarry to swim in, cliffs to jump off, trees to camp in, no long walking to anything, and a true family ownership that has deep roots in ohio. 2. Perfect weather all weekend. 3. Tons of Lotus Family in full force and a very pumped and danceready crowd otherwise, as always! 4. Lotus brought the Heat 110% and never looked back. From a debatebly perfect setlist..to flawless, mature improvs/jam sections and transitions..to moments of insanity and almost industrial/heavy metal(listen to parts of micksnack and hammerstrike! Mikey is so on fire i thought his guitar was gonna turn into a demon and eat our souls!)..to straight down and dirty funk stylee.. they covered so much ground, interpreting old material in new fresh ways, with a handfull of slightly newer songs, but in a way where the entire night had a cetain feel and flow to it that was all one cohesive unit. The Playing all around was superb and imo this will truely be considered an all time great Lotus show for years to come. The Recording itself is as flawless as the show, which makes this all the more worth it. The Universe (and Bean!) was making sure this night could be enjoyed, at least vicariosly, for everyone out there who has any sense of Lotus at all. Im not kidding, this is a true must own show.  The Set 1 Intro Improv set the mood for the entire night..listen and get the jist of that feel and you\'ll have a indication of where this is all going..which they took right into a smooth and slower Nematode, ever so slightly flubbing the transition(hey if im gonna give it a 5 and hype it up i gotta point out whatever flubs i can..when u listen i doubt youll even notice!), continuing the subtle danceparty vibe they set up, slowly building into the first signs of rage for the night before dropping back into the main theme and ending it. Then the familiar banjo sounding notes of Reich! Again continuing the slow estatic dance party as the sun was setting now..a very solid reich indeed..right into Slow Cookin\'..good good version also, calm..then funky..then slowly building into the first full on electronica of the night right into Moonset!! perfection. controlled. mature. building into a deep rage at the end. Very Nice. Next Came Livingston. I gotta say they for sure were outta synch for the first 2-3 min or so, which would be this only nights blatant nonperfection, but man do they recover. First its a farily normal storm..building into this weird almost aboriginal industrial weirdness. Lukes just usuing these wicked crazy tones underneath Mikeys usual Storm tones..its really interesting. Then whats this..like 30 secs or so of some bonafide feedback/space that drops right into a Sick Sick Sick Mikesnack! Man this ones hot!! Imma just say listen to it in its entirety and tell me anyone in the scene has better tone than Mikey..and hes just on fire! Now the set closer. Age of Inexperience. I gotta say this is one of my least fav lotus songs..i lit up a cig..they got through the opening composed section..i was like halfway done with my smoke..then the jam kicked in..Holy Heaven..i was drawn right back into the danceparty blackhole of goodness all around me. Wow this jam is massive. Hasnt sold me on the beginning of the song, but at least i know theres an sick jam coming after its over!(aka Twist from Phish, heh.) All in all at least a 7/10 first set that alone deserves a listen, with moments of brilliance all over it. But here comes the kicker. Set 2 of this show may be the best single set of lotus music ever, certainly the most mature and the most descriptive of their current mood and direction, all while usuing older material to illustrte this. I cant tell you enough about this set of music. To not hear it is ear-abuse. the operner Expired slang is always welcome, not to mention its flawless and everything that song could possibly be. Then the first sandwich of the night..Jump->Jug->Jump. Wow. Intense. Perfect. This may quite simply be the best juggarnaut ever. Beyond words while it was going down..the entire crowd just synched up into one psychic dance fever organism..that finally drops back into a raging jump ending that just seals the deal. You will love this, i thought this had to be the peak of the night. Oh no no no, my friends. What we have next is the Meat of the evening. Didd Fatt!!!! Oh glory how long i been wanting to catch this..right on with the ever evolving yet coherant mood of the night..so tight..leading right into the straight up, down and dirty, make you wanna f%$#, funk of Sid!! There had been hints of the funk all night that all came to a culmination in this sid. And suddenly right in the middle they drop into this phishesqe evil circus theme for a few seconds thats just freaky as hell..very nice. Again, just perfect mature jams and tight ass grooves...that leads right into Sermon!! Which just then proceeds to take the whole night to its final peak..right where it should be at the end of the second set. Danceparty isnt the word. We need a new Term for the Physicality of what goes down at a Lotus show cause its just 5 steps above. Such a clean vibe..so many smiles..such deep funk..what a night..what a scene. Then the owner Evan of nelsons comes out and gives a nice speech real quick, ensuring future Lotus Family gateherings at the Ledges! They Encore with Hammerstrike. At first i was hoping for a wax or spiritualize encore..but after listening 4x to the recording i realize this was the perfect closer to complete and dissolve the mood of the evening and release us all to the 6 hours of latenight goodness partying that then proceded to happen. This also may be a top version of hammerstrike..with Mikey again just slaughtering his guitar on this one near the end of the jam. Side notes: Dj Harry spun between sets and if you havent seen him yet make a point to..hes just amazing and so dirty. It was so nice to just wander 30 yards between sets and have him steal your face like what. A perfect night indeed.

Although I generally love Lotus performances and rate 5 stars...in retrospect this would either have to be a 6 or the others bumped to 4. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but Shaft is pretty much known for his pessimism around the Lotus camp. The show is #1 for me for these reasons: complexity of setlist, flawless seguing, range of genres covered, overall vibe, length, quality of recording, and the personal experience of being there. I\'ll give my track run down as well.\\n\\nSet 1:\\nThe opener Jam > Nematode was deliberately subtle and really got the crowd eager to see what was in store...Nematode is a refreshing jazzy version with a high powered jam finish. Reich has a beautiful and nourishing lead in. Chuck stands out hard on percussion during this number and it has a particularly dreamy/psychedelic jam. There is a very smooth and light segue into Slow Cooking which features a rare dark Lotus jam. Luke uses a really tight organ synth effect and the sound makes me picture a factory working on stage. Moonset set the place rocking and was implemented with full control. The Living Storm gets funky as hell with Jesse struttin out crisp baselines. It develops into an all out dance party with Mike leading with a soulful jam on guitar.  The Mikesnack is by far the dirtiest and funkiest version I have ever heard. Mike gets bluesy as hell and with performances like this solidifies himself as a rising star on the scene. The AoE to finish it off was straight funk. This song in particular has seen tremendous growth since its conception last fall. \\n\\nSet II\\nExpired Slang kickoff was tight and has a rock heavy jam. The Jump Off > Jugg > Jump off is straight up obnoxious and potentially the highlight of this incredible show for me. Jump off rocks off in regular high energy fashion and blends into a mystery/spacey jam in Jugg...it is really impossible to even tell its Jugg until about 3 min. into the song. It sails back into Jump Off with what can only be described as a rawkus Rage Against the Machine like jam. Raw guitar licks and deep synth effects. The Did Fatt kept its patented tribal groove and served for a short rest...but 7 min. in the bottom drops out into some sick DnB with Steve laying shit down on drums. 12 min. explodes into heavy guitar work. Sid goes from funky beach sides tropics into just straight up funk > FlowerSermon which was just 18 min of dance party mayhem. One particular moment Mike plays a slow, but beautiful and inspirational guitar lick over the fast paced dance grooves unlike I have ever heard in this song. Hammerstrike for the closer really matched the mood of the venue (Freedom and Liberation) and served as foreshadowing for the obnoxiously dirty Hammerstrike tour to come this fall.\\n\\nOverall, the show was extremely explorational. It show cased the versatility and cohesion of the band in its finest form. Sorry for the long review, but I felt it was important to articulate why this is a stand out performance instead of just flinging a thumbs up. Thanks Mike D. for an awesome review as well.

I have been listening to this band since highschool back in 2001 packed in a small attic stage in Pittsburgh called Club Laga. You could have not fit more than 40/50 people in there with a crowbar. Now they are damn near selling out every venue they hit across the country.

This isn\'t one of the best shows I\'ve seen them play, but it was good nonetheless.  In regards to the crowd, I can absolutely promise you that the largeness, youth, inexperience, and generally manners-challenged crowd at the show was not due to lotus.  Most of the young kids(under 18) were there for pgroove.  Ive seen both bands several times in the South and this is almost always true for pgroove shows.  the fact that it was an all-ages show on a friday night only exaggerated this further.  the reason that the crowd thinned out was most likely due to the show running past midnight and then 1 a.m.  I\'m sure that many of those kids had curfews.

Their light setup now is top notch, totally chill but excitingly psychedelic at the same time. Their second set seemed to bounce a little bit more than the first one, with some insane jams in there. Mike gave me the setlist after the show...that sandwich is friggin ridic. Flower Sermon > F# jam > trip (idk what this is supposed to mean) > Dowrn  > Sermon with accents in F# > Accents B > Sunrain. Whoa. Its cool to see that they have certain stuff written on the setlist to let the band know what kind of jam section will be coming up. I also noticed a lot of communication between Jesse and Luke up there. Everything was on point.\\n\\nThere was very little mistakes, and even the mistakes that were made were subtle and they did a great job of playing them off.

Although this is very clear sounding recording, at high volumes it seems to be missing something and shows some distortion.  Lupos is a very small club that is not very deep.  This recording sounds like it was made from the back wall of the venue, with the microphones pointing right at the speaker.  The venue sound may have been overpowering for the microphones at such a short distance.  Plus, you can hear the music bouncing off the walls.  There is also heavy background talking at certain low points in the music, but the chatting is still lower.  It is interesting hearing the chatting fighting with the sound from the speakers.  All in all, its a great recording showcasing the true venue sound and really makes you feel like you are at the show.\\n\\n\\nSETLIST NOTE:  Disc 1 Track 9 and 10 are both the two sections of GOBNUGGET.  The song POTAMUS was not played.  Disc 2 Track 1 opens up with a women performing spoken word.\\n\\nREVIEW: DOWNLOAD THIS SHOW!\\n\\nThis show is worth downloading because of a unique set list accompanied by the strong musical playing from the band.  This show has some very unique twists and turns throughout the show, but those may only mean something to you if you are familiar with the band on some level.  This show makes good soundtrack material for driving in the car and should be in anyones collection who is seriously trying to obtain a library of STS9 of live show.\\n\\nA yet to be identified NEW SONG kicks things off with a nice fluid beat to get the crowd warmed up.  This then beautifully segues into FREQUENCY 2!  This seems like an odd placement for the song, and it gets odder when they dont segue into Freq. 3.  Instead, the classic build rise of Freq. 2 is left to itself.  From there, the band moves into a long extended JEBEZ, featuring some beautiful tones and moods from the guitar and bass.  The fast paced energy and beats of the songs DANCE and STS9 in the first set feel out of place, but are very welcome to this unique set.  Jeffree lays down some wicked percussion towards the end of the first section of STS9, while the second section is ultra short but features some unique flute samples and heavenly breathing sounds from the keyboard.  Sandwiched in between is a beautifully flowing rendition of SATORI.   A solid version of ONCE TOLD then has the crowd showing appreciation for the new material, a nice sign.  Right from the start, the GOBNUGGET has the guitar and keyboards are laying down some nasty funky rhythms in the first section of the song.  The second section of the song is a mainly composed section that sounds like youre on a boat traveling through tunnels.  This section turns into a classical jamming experience as the band builds towards greatness with full piano and melting guitars.\\n\\nThe second set opens with TAP IN to much crowd approval.  The song works its way through the composition building incredible steam through the 4 and 5 minute marks.  The tension finally gets released around 5:30 as the band moves their way into the possible highlight of this song.  The unique intricate group jamming experience here just about always has both the band audience held in a transcending moment together.  At the 6:53 mark, the band moves into the next section of the song for more inspired fluid playing similar to the Satori from the first set.  The closing section begins around 11:20 and is only 40 seconds long.  By December 2003, the band began to extend out this closing section into a new place to hang out and improvise.\\n\\nWATER SONG is also greeted too much crowd approval.  This version features a beautiful extended introduction section that moves along to the 3:30 mark.  (The section that starts at 3:30 is repeated again at the 9:35 mark.)  At the 4:37, Hunter plays some distorted version of the theme different then anything I have heard.  At 5:05, Hunters composed guitar section begins to weave them into the double speed jam that starts at 5:55 and runs to 8:58.  This is where the song explodes into another transcending musical experience from intricate group jamming.  You really have to listen to all the instruments together as a single vehicle to appreciate what the band does when it hits these strides.  The closing section of the song is marked by beautiful piano work.  The song ends with the samples Listen more closely.\\n\\nA rare BLU MOOD sounds delicious from the opening notes.  A few fans in attendance are very excited and know what is going on!  The spicy guitar work mixed with the down tempo bass and cutting percussion soon has everyone excited.   The backside is oozing with beautiful emotional that makes me want to cry tears of joy.  At 5:20, an old school synthesized sound takes the song in new direction.\\n\\nThe NEW SONG sounds like a movie soundtrack piece.  It has ambient classical music building with beautiful composed guitar work intertwined.  This is accompanied by a rhythm section of flowing baselines and feverous drumming.\\n\\nMOONSOCKETS features some more unique styling from the band, such as the unique chord progressions during the first chorus section at 4:40.  The second section jam breaks down into the new composed ending the band added to the song in early 2003.  This can be heard as the song crosses the 6 minute mark.  The guitar work and percussion remind me of Santana.\\n\\nThis first section of WELL MEET IN OUR DREAMS is an experience that makes me smile.  The second section gets into more intricate group jamming.  This is followed by a raging version BREATHE IN.  As the band crosses the 5:30 mark, the closing section of the song is highlighted by beautiful piano and drum work.\\n\\nAfter Murphy mentions the high energy of the crowd, the show encores with a cover song by the 80s/90s band Dee-Lite, WHAT IS LOVE.  This is a perfectly executed version that ends in a rage of furry on percussion.  This was a perfect topping to a memorable show.\",\"reviewtitle\":\"Unique setlist with some different twists!\",\"reviewer\":\"Cory Ferber\",\"reviewdate\":\"2004-05-28 10:35:30\",\"stars\":\"4\"},{\"review_id\":\"49395\",\"reviewbody\":\"I feel like I\'ve already listened to the show after reading the review below.

The mid-range and high end are crystal clear, just wonderful, but the bass is lacking.  Although I have heard Neumann-sourced shows that have awesome bass, usually they\'re like this one where the bass is reduced to a dull thunder in the background. Overall a fine sounding show, but the lack of punchy, room-filling bass is a bit of a drag.  Schoeps, on the other hand, can have the opposite problem in which the bass overwhelms the rest of the music and muddys everything else up.

HOWEVER, if you turn the bass down far, it evens out a little more.  If you have a woofer, turn it up w/the bass set down on the receiver.  I probably shoulda used the rolloff feature on it, but decided not too.

This recording sounds like it was made from the back of the room in a tapers section.  It has clear sound with a large amount of audience noise in the foreground.  Nevertheless, they are very excited and add to the flavor of this spicy recording.  This is a truly classic sounding audience recording for anyone who has listened to a lot of live recordings.  Its not perfect, but that is the actually appeal.  It sounds like you are right there inside the room.  When people yap or yell, you get goose bumps because they are so close.  It reminds me of old school cassette days.  Thank you Team 9!.\\n\\nREVIEW:  DOWNLOAD THIS SHOW!\\n\\nThe bands debut in Columbia is nothing short of astonishing.  Although the band had not played their, its safe to assume some of the audience members are familiar with the bands music through CDs or seeing the band on the festival circuit.  Its also safe to assume there were a lot of newbies seeing their first STS9 show.  This puts the band in just the right mood to do something special.  The band pulls out 10 songs debuted in or before 2001!!  This show contains many of the bands most beautiful and inspiring compositions, following a theme that is hard to describe.  I wish I could have attended this show because it is a transcending experience.  \\n\\nFrom the first moments of the recording, you can feel the excitement in the air.  This immediately gets reflected on the band that opens up with an old school classic, MONKEY MUSIC.  This is an interesting choice for a crowd who potentially is not as familiar with your music as some of the larger cities where the band has played over a dozen times.  This song is nice way to ease into a show for both the band and the audience. \\n\\nJEBEZ is a good demonstration of the healing power of music.  David Phipps works his magic on this one, stretching and holding the chords like a rising sun, while also adding improvisational piano work over top.  The rest of the band grooves along with their own twitchy interlocking jam.\\n\\nEQUINOX, GROW, ONCE TOLD are a nice triple threat of structured composition into flowing house jam into sensory overload.  The crowd really enjoys Equinox, assumingly familiar with the song from SEASONS 01.  David Phipps does some incredible work on the end of Once Told while the others continually interact on a molecular level.\\n\\nSURREALITY > EB get back to old school 9.  The Surreality has a nice 2 plus minute introduction, showing the bands confidence to continue to stretch out different sections of a song at different times played.  This is a core part of improvisational nature of the band.  EB rips in around the 5:12 mark and sees the band lifting off into classic old school outer space jam territory.  Hunter is way up front and all over the place, seemingly pulling and pushing the tempo, while Phipps showers the crowd with radiating notes.\\n\\nThe second set opens with the People are you ready sample of RILLY WUT.  This song has matured a lot since its debuted in December 2002.  Like most STS9 songs, its the small details that need to be heard to understand their purpose in jamming.  This version, although seeming the same as everyone other one, is all over the place in new directions.  The sequence from around 2:55 to 4: 46 is excellent.  Even when you know every twist and turn of the song, there style of jamming right over top of a structured sequence leaves one in astonishment.  This continues throughout the rest of the song.\\n\\nThe IMPROV is incredible!  It is very old school sounding with hits of EB and Orbital.  David Murphy lays down a flowing and pulling base line while the rest of band all display incredible talent in musical communication.  This one leaves you breathless and gets a strong crowd approval.  \\n\\nAnother great SQUARES AND CUBES (remix03), with an extended introduction and beautiful new sections starting at 3:35 and again at 5:48.  The band then slowly climbs through the same musical sequence landing them once again in opening chords of the new section at the 8:44 mark.  Like a musical soundtrack, the band reaches their crescendo and then brings it back down to ease us out.  \\n\\nCRYTSAL INSTRUMENT made its debut at Earth Dance 2003 in Golden Gate Park where the band played the band played out in nature surrounded by large tress and green grass.  Billed under their alter ego name TZOLKIN, the band played an electronic drum circle for the 22nd Century.  This song embodies three strong qualities of San Francisco: earthy, jazzy, and futuristic.  This is an astonishing version with Jeffree stepping up out front.  The first section seems light and airy while the second section is cloudy and foggy.\\n\\nThrough the haze comes some old school 9 with TWELVE!  This song continues to shift overtime as different sections of the composition have been extended in time and the expense shrinking other sections.  It has altered the jamming nature of the song while being able to keep the feelings in place.  This versin is a slippery ride and should be heard.      \\n\\nA moving FROM NOW ON segues directly into a touching BARAKA.  The band then encores with an double punch of WATER SONG > INSPIRE STRIKES BACK, very similar in nature to the Water>Dance pairing from 4/2/04.  I was so mesmerizerd by these 4 tunes that I am speechless.  It would need another 4 long paragraphs to explain my feelings about this sequence.  An incredible way to close down this old school show.\\n\\nDuring ISB, Hunter teases BOSSO PROFUNDO from 4:20 through 5:16, then lands at the common EVASIVE/MOONSOCKETS theme for a brief moment before moving back into the closing sequence of ISB.  [See 4/2/2004 review.]  I love this stuff!  The ability to appreciate STS9 is something that deepens with your knowledge of the music.  If youre a casual listener, or a new fan, sequences like this have little meaning in greater context while others find themselves lost in jubilation.  Its all in the details.\",\"reviewtitle\":\"Old School Night with 10 songs debuted in or before 2001!\",\"reviewer\":\"Cory Ferber\",\"reviewdate\":\"2004-05-24 00:44:01\",\"stars\":\"5\"},{\"review_id\":\"14758\",\"reviewbody\":\"The Blue Note travelled to other galaxies, reaching far and wide.... although it was the bands first show in Columbia, there was a great turnout and the band and audience fed off each others energy....  this old theater is a dump, truth be known, but it is small and intimate, and Steve made it sound terrific as usual... my favorite of the five nights that follow.

This is a well balanced mixed that probably reveals the true venueÂs sound.  The recording sounds like itÂs directly in front of a speaker.  The keyboards, guitar, and drums are upfront in mix.  The bass and percussion are just below them in the mix.  The bass is occasionally too loud and bleeds, but it might have even been this way at the show.  Thank you Team 9!\\n\\nREVIEW:  DOWNLOAD THIS SHOW!\\n\\nThe bandÂs return to Detroit was marked by a special one off PROGRESSIVE SESSIONS show with LTJ BUKEM and MC CONRAD on a Saturday night.  After a highly successful team up last fall, it was nice to see them joining forces once again for a live show.  This one set show is loaded with new dance beats from STS9, featuring 8 of their newer songs debuted in the last year or so.\\n\\nThis new version of TOKYO is beautiful.  It features the new heavy synthesized funk section starting around the 5 minute mark, and then gives way to an ambient improve section just past the 7 minute mark.  The band wanders around as Hunter and David Phipps explore some nice ambient territory on guitars on keys.\\n\\nThe SQUARES AND CUBES (remix03) is just stunning!  This song continues to move into new directions with the addition of the new sections (starting at 3:53 and 7:59).  Here, they are long and developed jams that explore the new sections.  Hunter leads the band through some tunnels that exploit the new sections connection to the original song in the first jam.  As he wanders around confidently with purpose, the rest of the band move the music back into the original composition.  And just when you think were back, we leave again for another journey!\\n\\nThe first IMPROV is on the ambient funk side, sounding similar in nature tail end of TAP IN or WMIOD.  Zach and Jeffree lay down some fast grooves while Murphy slides us along the song keeping us in groove.  When you hear music like this, youÂre not sure if you should be dancing super super fast to the drums, or just sort of wobble around in the clouds listening to Hunter and Phipps.  Around the 6:30 minute mark, it sounds like someone is teasing the introduction to NAUTILUS, as if to suggest they should seque.\\n\\nAfter another twisted TWILIGHT, the band moves directly into classic old school with ORBITAL.  From the confident and solid introduction, you know this is going to be a great version.  Zach and Jeffree are locked in and envelope the band as the move along the composition.  Zach is constantly throwing in extra beats all over the place, distorting the rhythm in new ways that send his team mates off into new directions.  The ability of the 5 of them to past musical sequences around is mind boggling, culminating in a climax at the 12 minute mark.  This version is also notable because it lacks the OTHERWISE FORMLESS section that part of the song and usually is played 2 or 3 times.\\n\\nThe second IMPROV is somewhat synth-rock, featuring Hunter and Phipps in an extended conversation while the rest of the band grooves along.\\n\\nMC CONRAD makes his appearance to close down the set with the band.  Coming out during a cover of NAUTILUS, he comments on the music saying, Âold school with a futuristic twist!Â  He then launches into his own style of rap beat that has made him famous the world over.  Although his lyrics are sometimes hard to explain, if you listen carefully you can just about make out every word of his rap.\\n\\nThe band then closes the set with GLOGLI, a song named after LTJ BukemsÂs record label Good Looking Organization.  This song is actually a remix of the Solitude 3 by another GLO artist named Marcel.  This was the perfect choice to close down the Progressive Sessions show and lead into the Bukem/Conrad set.\",\"reviewtitle\":\"Special Spring Tour Progressive Sessions show with MC Conrad!\",\"reviewer\":\"Cory Ferber\",\"reviewdate\":\"2004-05-24 00:33:17\",\"stars\":\"5\"},{\"reviewbody\":\"The Improv is called F-Word, its in the key of F, so no, its not just a clever name....this was a great show. \\\"Tie your shoelaces tight!\\\"\\n\\nWould\'ve given it a 5-star if they had played longer!

This recording sounds like it was made from the back of the room in a tapers section.  It has clear sound with audience noise in background.  The guitar and drums are upfront in mix.  The bass is contained and not distorted.  Thank you Team 9!\\n\\nREVIEW: DOWNLOAD THIS SHOW!\\n\\nAfter playing a string of shows at the House of Blues, the Tribes first show at the Vic Theater blows the roof off the building.  Although I was not at this show, I have been enjoying it immensely on CD.  This is a show I will come back to again and again!  \\n\\nThe first set and second set both showcase a well balanced set list for STS9.  The band moves effortlessly between songs from the beginning of the career into their newer material from late 2003 and 2004. \\n\\nThe show opens with a loose SQUARES AND CUBES (remix03) that is given time to wander and find its way at over 12 minutes long.  MOVEMENTS then moves us further along into the double speed jam of FOR MY PEEPS where things finally climax.  After moving into some emotional territory with FROM NOW ON and ASAA, the band jets forward into a cover of NAUTILUS.  After bringing up the funk, things go wild with MOONSOCKETS.  This is a very interesting version with a long extended BOSSO PROFUNDO tease from 4:52 through 6:03.  [See 3/29/2004 review.]  The closing TOKYO features the new addition of a second section of the song starting at 5:06. It eventually fades into a long extended ambient jam to close the set.\\n\\nThe second set opens BLU MOOD, with a much extended version since returning to the set list in late 2003.  TWILIGHT shows the spacey ambient sampling side of the Tribe in a new freaky light.  I like the addition of a song like this to repertoire.  It warned of the upcoming mayhem ahead on RAMONE AND EMIGLIO.  In this version, Zach and Jeffree are locked in and lead the boys through a complex double speed jam (starting at 2:46) that sounds like they are slowly peeling back the layers on an onion, each one getting sweeter and sweeter.  In the second half of the song, David Phipps lays down some extreme slow motion funk as Hunter lays down some signature rhythm guitar work.  \\n\\nBREATHE IN is always beautiful experience and this version doesnt disappoint.  The band works its way effortlessly through the first section, a throwback to old style Tribe.  The second section, starting at 5:20, is best described in one word: California!  I think this song shows how the bands music changed and matured since moving to the left coast.  The band takes their time as David closes the song with some beautiful piano work.  \\n\\nThe show closes with what will be one of the best jams of the year, a sublime WATER SONG > DANCE, with a smooth seque that is almost unnoticeable!  These two were meant to be paired together like peanut butter and jelly.  The DANCE ends with some wicked intensified jamming smashed on top of the composition!  After the song, David Murphy comments Thanks for pulling that out of us.  A nice LUMA DAYLIGHTS encored closed down the show with the band giving it one last burst to the excited Chicago crowd.\",\"reviewtitle\":\"STS9 blows the roof off the building!\",\"reviewer\":\"Cory Ferber\",\"reviewdate\":\"2004-05-24 00:29:28\",\"stars\":\"5\"},{\"review_id\":\"20785\",\"reviewbody\":\"This show was amazing.

Tragically, this recording is much like all the others: way too much crowd. When I can hear the content of individual conversations, something has gone wrong. Ever notice that the soundboards from sts9music don\'t have any audible crowd chatter? That\'s because no one wants to hear it. I understand this isn\'t a soundboard, but even during the peaks of songs, I can still hear the people blabbing.

It sounded the exact same way that night and sounds about the way every Ga Theatre recording sounds.  Personally, I like listening to this more than sterile sounding sbd recordings and actually wish there were more ambient crowd mixed in...now there\'s none.

I was at this show and when i saw your mic set up i thought it was one of the craziest things ive ever seen a taper attempt, your audacity does not go unnoticed. for those of you not there- zach had his rig stage left, almost right above z.velmer, in the upper level,(not a balcony) w/ a mic in front of the stack, wedged b/w the railing and another mic all the way around the top of the venue in a symmetrical position in front of of the stage right speakers just in front of phipps. the result was not only a crispy recording of the PA sound, but since the room was so small, the stage amps, and especiallly the drums were recorded in the mix as if it were live at a recording studio. Great sounding drums- it was a treat seeing zach play half his kit-he was killing it.\\n\\nthis show was a bit of a throwback to the shows of old, with the song selection and small crowd. we drove down from ATL to see the jax show hoping to hear most of Artifact (if you dont got it-get it) but instead the boys ripped a majority of there older material- check out the freq2>3 for starters and the awesome Sur>EB to end the first set.

Get into that song if you haven\'t gotten the concept yet.  Very psychedelic indeed.  Kamuy all by itself, almost akward to hear the intro to that song, but still living up to its reputation.

They round off the first set with a good ole Dance.  Hunter has the flange turned to the \\\"sick & nasty\\\" setting.  Props to the guy who yells \\\"Dance\\\" on the first diddy, yeah you knew what was up.\\n\\nThe new tribal Konami-jam Be Nice has another round, right into a Shiva destroying Open E with a drawn out cymbol-bashing outro.  Newly created One A Day  is next, a nice little drop out for Phipps and Hunter to lay down the funk riff.  Top tier performance as usual on Mischief of a Sleepwalker.  The electric drum sample break down sounds like it glitched and repeats itself for a minute, but Zach saves the song and leads the band into an explosive ending.  Arigato > Call Jam is sounding good, I\'m liking the improv a whole lot.  They cut down the time by about 4 minutes coming in at 10:56 min.  Sick Hubble again, keep it up fellas!  Classic Moon Socket as usual with some funky improv come second verse, that song seems to be on lock this tour.  I\'m loving the keyboard sounds Phipps has on this song as well as throughout this whole show (refer back to d&b break on ReEmergence 1/27/06 Fillmore, CO)\\n\\n4 stars for quality/minimal crowd noise, 4 stars for performance.\\n\\nThanks for the show fellas\\n\\n-Art\",\"reviewtitle\":\"Hey, it\'s better than Chicago\",\"reviewer\":\"ThisisArt\",\"reviewdate\":\"2010-06-13 01:10:02\",\"stars\":\"4\"},{\"reviewbody\":\"booming in your face sound!!!\\nand no people yakking right next to the taper... this is a splendid recording! i\'m listening to \\\"be pulse\\\" right now and being reminded once again how NO BAND has ever sounded like this in the history of recorded music--- STS9 are very very special and i\'m thankful to exist on Earth during the same era as them!\\nthanks for the music and thanks even more for making it available to all of us at home to listen to and enjoy!\",\"reviewtitle\":\"whew!\",\"reviewer\":\"maximusprime\",\"reviewdate\":\"2007-04-28 13:49:25\",\"stars\":\"4\"}]',3,4.33,587,'2013-11-09 10:12:49','2013-11-09 10:12:49',386,3,8273,15,0),

King Pharaoh\'s Tomb finally sneaks back into the setlist, the crowd is quite confused at this point, but continues to hold it down enjoying some rare reggae that sound tribe has been waiting to unleash to the crowd.\\n\\n-Art\",\"reviewtitle\":\"Ohh yeeah\",\"reviewer\":\"ThisisArt\",\"reviewdate\":\"2006-02-18 15:02:25\",\"stars\":\"5\"},{\"review_id\":\"64491\",\"reviewbody\":\"I downloaded this show because of the eloquent review below.

Others will always pack Phillips Arena to hopefully catch a glimpse of of John Bell and that WSP magic, but the people that are \'in the know\' end up at the Tabernacle. \\n\\nWELL worth the download for the 1st set alone, they cover their first album Interplanetary Escape Vehicle (IEV) in its\' entirety. They have come a LONG way from their early career (99\'-02\') which relied heavily on Drum&Bass and Improv during their concerts. During this time period STS9 had a much slimmer rotation of songs which allowed them to really open up, and they created some beautiful improvisations.  However, there new material can best be described as GANG BUSTER. There new album Peaceblaster is a real solid showing for the band.  \\n\\nThe first set opened with a lot of energy with MoonSockets. I personally liked Wika Chikana best in that set, but everything after 4 Year Puma is essential listening, especially the Evasive Maneuvers! \\n\\nThey paired Tooth and This, Us to kick off a high energy 2nd Set. They originally were going to open with Water Song, as was written on the setlist, but they wanted to bring a lot of energy I suppose. It worked, and the following Grow/Open E was the easy highlight of the set. Peoples was good, but check out the 12/30/06 version for a true monster.  Baraka tied up a great show in Ga.\\n\\nIt was a tale of two sets.

R&E was excellent, and the Grizzly is also excellent. Hunter does some awesome guitar work which absolutely smokes the Oct. 2009 Milwaukee version out of the water (no guitar at all). This was a really fun show. I believe it is the second summerfest show in a row in which I brought some non jamband/electronica peeps to the show and they loved it.\\n\\nRecording is much better than I expected.
